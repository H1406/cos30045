            <p>Understanding and managing energy consumption is crucial for Australian households and businesses. With rising electricity costs and environmental concerns, making informed decisions about appliance usage can lead to significant savings and reduced carbon footprint.</p>
            
            <section class="energy-info">
                <h2>Why Energy Efficiency Matters</h2>
                <p>The average Australian household spends over $2,000 annually on electricity. By choosing energy-efficient appliances and understanding consumption patterns, you can reduce costs while contributing to a sustainable future.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Energy Statistics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heating and cooling account for 40% of household energy use</li>
                    <li>Hot water systems contribute approximately 25% of energy consumption</li>
                    <li>Appliances and electronics make up about 35% of household energy use</li>

            <h1>Television Energy Consumption</h1>
            <p>Televisions are one of the most common household appliances in Australia, with most homes having multiple units. Understanding their energy consumption can help you make informed purchasing decisions.</p>

            <section class="tv-tips">
                <h2>Reducing TV Energy Consumption</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adjust brightness settings - factory settings are often unnecessarily high</li>
                    <li>Enable power-saving modes available in most modern TVs</li>
                    <li>Turn off completely rather than leaving on standby (standby can use 1-5 watts)</li>
                    <li>Consider screen size - larger screens consume more power</li>
                    <li>Check energy star ratings when purchasing new televisions</li>

                    This section uses official Australian television energy rating data to explore
                    how different television characteristics influence annual energy consumption.
                    The visualisations focus on factors that matter most to consumers, including
                    screen size, display technology, and brand-level efficiency.

                    <p class="viz-context">
                        This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between television screen size
                        (in inches) and annual energy consumption (kWh/year). While energy usage
                        generally increases with screen size, the plot shows considerable variation,
                        indicating that energy efficiency differs significantly between models.
